**News Delivery Web App**

A web application designed to deliver both local and global news for different cities across the United States.

**Application Setup**

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

**1. API Key Configuration**

Replace the API_KEY string in the application with your OPEN AI Key. This is necessary for classifying the news articles by their location. Without this key, the application won't be able to classify articles properly.

**2. Server Setup**

Run the server-side of the application. Ensure that the backend is up and running to handle the requests and provide the necessary data.

**3. Frontend Setup**

Navigate to the news-delivery-app/client folder and run the following command to start the frontend:
npm run start

**4. Wait for Classification**

Once the application is running, it may take up to 2 minutes for the application to classify the articles based on their location.

**5. Use the Application**

After the classification process is complete, you will see a search input field.

Search for a city within the U.S. to see local and state news related to that city.

You can toggle the switch on the right to view global news.
